# Little Garden 

by Hallie, Asmahan, Peter, Maria


## ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ·ðŸŒ¼ Introduction


Little Garden is a mobile first, responsive eccommerce site to purchase plants.


### What are you building?

An e-commerce website for a fake brand. This is a full stack application hosted on Vercel and built with React, next.JS and with data stored on Elephant PostgreSQL.



### Why are you building it?

The purpose of this project was to practice using React and Next.js. Solidify our understanding of PSQL database and refresh our memory of cookies.



## ðŸª´ Project scope

With more time as a group we would have implemented and completed a basket which would have stored users choice in plant for purchasing later, user would be able to add as many items as they wished.


### What are you not building? (stretch goals that were discarded?)

We are not building an application that supports filtering or sorting the producst on the page.

### How did you decide what features were important?

We considered the user journey and user stories and the purpose of the application. This helped guide what features to prioritise and the order in which we should start building them.

As it's an e-commerce website, we started with a database of products for users to  "buy".



## Project plan

1. Set up the project;
2. Create project board on the Github and add some issues;
3. Create user stories;
4. Divide roles and tasks;
5. Regular checkings;

## Project learnings:

* First project built with Next.js and Postgres database;
* Practiced more modularising;
* More React practice; 

### Did your team work effectively?

Yes- we communicated clearly and took time to discuss any issues and work through them together. In the process, we ensured each team member understood the code to prioritise learning over the completion of the project.


### What would you do differently next time?

Taken accessibility into consideration from the beginning. 


### How will you ensure your project is accessible to as many users as possible?


Semantic HTML, such as forms with labels and inputs, anchor tags for links and sections where used for the consideration of screen readers and users who would naviagte the page by keyboard. 

Unfortunatly, we didn't have enough time to run a lighthouse report, colour contrast checks or do a manual screen reader test. If we had more time this would have been done. 


### What features would you prioritise to build next?

I would be nice to implement the functionality to add items to the basket and delete items from the basket.
Then, it would be nice to add the functionality of the search bar.
Accessability tests would probably be a good idea too.


### Was the project a success?

I would would say it was a success, we all had fun with the project, collaborated and paired on completed tasks :smiley_cat:
